## Description

CryptiQ is an AI-powered Digital Forensics Analysis tool designed to ingest, parse, and analyze complex Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFDR) reports.

* Natural Language Query Engine: Ask questions in plain English (e.g., "Show me all outgoing calls to this number") to filter evidence.
* AI-Driven Insights: Automatically detects patterns, anomalies, and key information from communication logs.
* Multi-Format Support: Compatible with standard data formats including Excel (.xlsx), CSV, JSON, and Text files.
* Interactive Dashboard: Real-time visualization of call logs, messages, timestamps, and location data.
* Automated Reporting: Generates professional, downloadable PDF reports containing query summaries and evidence tables.
